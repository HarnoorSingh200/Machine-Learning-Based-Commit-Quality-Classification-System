THIS FILE IS TO NOTIFY WHAT WHOLE READABILITY FOLDER IS DOING

THE READABILITY FOLDER IS EXTRACTED FROM OPEN SOURCE PYTHON MODULE CALLED 'py-readability-metrics 1.4.5'

LINK TO ACCESS ORIGINAL SOURCE CODE = https://pypi.org/project/py-readability-metrics/#flesch-kincaid-grade-level

ALL THE EXCESS ELEMENT ARE DELETED SO WE ARE ONLY LEFT WITH CODE WHICH WE NEED FOR 'flesch_kincaid' readability metric

I HAVE ALSO MODIFY THE CODE SO IT CAN GET READABILITY SCORE FOR TEXT WITH LESS THAN 100 WORDS. THIS CHANGE IS DONE IN
FLESCH_KINCAID.PY

IN FLESCH_KINCAID.PY I have removed all the code necessary to get grade level score.
